# üéÆ VORTEK2D ‚Äì A Simple 2D Game Engine for Learning and Teaching

VORTEK2D is a lightweight, educational 2D game engine built with the goal of **learning by doing** üß†üí°. It's part of my journey to understand game development from the ground up ‚Äî and share everything I learn through my [YouTube channel]([https://www.youtube.com/](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3HUvSWOJR7XRDwVVQqqWO-zyyscb8L-v)) üì∫‚ú®.

> This engine isn‚Äôt meant to compete with big names like Unity or Godot ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay!  
> It‚Äôs about exploring, building, breaking things, and **growing as a developer** üöÄ.

Whether you're here to learn alongside me, peek at the source, or just curious about making your own engine, welcome! üëã

üõ† **Why VORTEK2D?**

- ‚úÖ Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è for education
- üéì Teach what I learn, and learn what I teach
- üéÆ Build real 2D games from scratch
- üí¨ Collaborate, share ideas, and grow together

# Build
----
Requires [CMake 3.26](https://cmake.org/) and [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
## Get VCPKG:
```ps
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.bat -disableMetrics
```
### Make sure the following environment variables are set:
```
VCPKG_ROOT=[path_to_vcpkg]
VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET=x64-windows
```

- Windows

	Add the following line in your Path environnment variable:
	```
	<path_to_vcpkg_installation_folder>
	```

	Open a terminal and type the following:
	```
	vcpkg integrate install
	vcpkg integrate powershell
	```

- Linux

	Edit your profile's bashrc file:
	```
	nano ~/.bashrc
	```
	Add the following lines at the end:
	```
	export PATH=<path_to_vcpkg_installation_folder>:$PATH
	export VCPKG_ROOT=<path_to_vcpkg_installation_folder>
	export VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET=x64-linux
	```
	Apply changes:
	```
	source ~/.bashrc
	```

	Open a terminal and type the following:
	```
	vcpkg integrate install
	vcpkg integrate bash
	```
	
## Install dependencies 
- Windows
	```
	vcpkg install fmt glm entt glad soil2 sdl2 sdl2-mixer lua sol2 stb tinyfiledialogs rapidjson
	```
- Linux[debian based]
	```
	sudo apt install python-jinja2 autoconf automake libtool pkg-config libibus-1.0-dev
	```
	* if[Xorg]
		 ```
		sudo apt install libx11-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev
		```
	* if[Wayland]
		```
		sudo apt install libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libegl1-mesa-dev
		```
	* Optional but good practice
		```
		sudo apt install build-essential
		```
	```
	vcpkg install fmt glm entt glad soil2 sdl2[alsa] sdl2-mixer lua sol2 stb tinyfiledialogs rapidjson
	```
- ImGui Docking and SDL2-Binding
  * It seems like the ```ImGui[sdl2-binding]``` no longer exists in vcpkg. Also the current ```Imgui[docking-experimental]``` does not seem to be up to date either.
  * For now, we grabbed the latest from the docking imgui branch and build with the editor. I have added the necessary files under the [thirdparty](https://github.com/dwjclark11/VORTEK2D/tree/master/thirdparty/imgui_backends) folder.
  * These should already be setup in cmake.
  * Will move back to using vcpkg bindings once the correct version is available.
- Box2d Install
  * There has been a huge change in the latest box2d that is a breaking change to our codebase.
  * We are using Box2D 2.41, the latest 3.1, uses a C-API that is done in a completely different way.
  * Eventually we are going to have to update the code to support the latest; however, we currently have a work around.
  * Please see the ```Readme.md``` file here [VORTEK_PHYSICS](https://github.com/dwjclark11/VORTEK2D/tree/master/VORTEK_PHYSICS) for the workaround steps.
    
## Clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/dwjclark11/VORTEK2D.git
cd VORTEK2D
cmake -S . -B build
```
 
* Also, in the main.lua file for the editor, comment out the loaded assets and files that don't exist. They will just error out.

## Use the built-in OpenGL debugger
Note: this requires a graphics adapter with OpenGL version >= 4.3 capabilities.

In VORTEK2D/CMakeLists.txt:
* Set the variable ```VORTEK_OPENGL_DEBUG_CALLBACK``` to ```ON```.
* Optionnaly, set the variable ```VORTEK_OPENGL_DEBUG_FORWARD_COMPATIBILITY``` to ```ON``` in order to enable warnings about deprecated OpenGL functions.

Activate the debugger in your code as soon as you have a valid OpenGL context made current:
* ```VORTEK_RENDERING::OpenGLDebugger::init()```.
* Optionnaly, you can opt out a list of warning wy doing the following:
	```
	std::vector<unsigned int> ignore{ 1281, 131169, 131185, 131204, 31218 };
	VORTEK_RENDERING::OpenGLDebugger::init( ignore );
	```

* To allow the debugger to break, call ```VORTEK_RENDERING::OpenGLDebugger::breakOnError( true/false )``` and/or ```VORTEK_RENDERING::OpenGLDebugger::breakOnWarning( true/false )```.
* To ignore a specific warning, call ```VORTEK_RENDERING::OpenGLDebugger::push( Id )```.
* To reinstate, call ```VORTEK_RENDERING::OpenGLDebugger::pop( Id )```.
* To set the severity level, call ```VORTEK_RENDERING::OpenGLDebugger::setSeverityLevel( VORTEK_RENDERING::OpenGLDebuggerSeverity::Disable/Notification/Low/Medium/High )```.

## Force the discrete GPU on Optimus laptops
In VORTEK2D/CMakeLists.txt:
* Set the variable ```VORTEK_OPENGL_FORCE_DISCRETE_GPU``` to ```ON```.
Note: Ids can differ between platforms or drivers.
Note for linux users: this is currently working only on nVidia GPUs.
